        <h2>My Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The Sustainability Summit was a great experience. I learned a lot about how to help the environment through better engineering and technology. It was inspiring to hear people talk about the importance of sustainability and how we can all make a difference.

            One of the most important things I learned is that sustainability should be a part of our everyday lives. I will try to use these ideas in my future work. I’m excited to share everything I learned with others at UBCO and encourage them to get involved in sustainability.

        <h2>What UBCO Could Adopt from Other Schools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Spaces for Innovation:</strong> Other schools offer more dedicated, flexible collaboration spaces for students during conferences and events, designed for brainstorming, networking, and hands-on workshops.</li>
            <li><strong>Live Event Streaming/Apps for Real-Time Updates:</strong> Some conferences use event apps or live-streaming platforms to share schedules, real-time updates, and speaker information, keeping participants informed.</li>
            <li><strong>Sustainability Initiatives:</strong> Many schools incorporate zero-waste policies and environmentally friendly practices, such as digital brochures, reusable materials, and eco-conscious catering.</li>
            <li><strong>International Collaboration:</strong> Some schools have strong international partnerships and bring in speakers or hold virtual events with global experts, creating opportunities for international collaboration.</li>
        </ul>
